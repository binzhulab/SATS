\details{
  This file consists of the list \code{SimData} with the following objects: 
  \itemize{
    \item{V} {: Simulated mutation catalog matrix of size 96 by 10027
	            generated from the Poisson distribution with the mean 
				corresponding to each element of L*(WH), where * is 
				elementwise multiplication, L is the panel size matrix 
				below, W is the profile matrix of the tumor mutation 
				burden (TrueW_TMB below), and H is the signature activity 
				matrix (TrueH below).
	}
    \item{L} {: Panel size matrix of size 96 by 10027.}
    \item{W_TMB} {: Tumor mutation burden based signatures size 96 by 76.}
    \item{TrueH} {: Simulated signature activity matrix of size 6 by 10027 used to generate V.}
    \item{TrueW_TMB} {: Tumor mutation burden based signatures size 96 by 6
                        for 6 SBS signatures (SBS1, SBS2/13, SBS4, SBS5, SBS40, SBS89) 
						used to generate V.
