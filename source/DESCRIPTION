Description: This package is created to perform mutational signature analysis for targeted sequenced tumors. Unlike the canonical analysis of mutational signatures, SATS factorizes the mutation counts matrix into a panel context matrix (measuring the size of the targeted sequenced genome for each tumor in the unit of million base pairs (Mb)), a signature profile matrix, and a signature activity matrix. SATS also calculates the expected number of mutations attributed by a signature, namely signature expectancy, for each targeted sequenced tumor.
